# AI Chatbot for support

Building a Chatbot for Generating GraphQL and Custom Queries for Cohort Descriptions . 

This project aims to develop a chatbot powered by ChatGPT or another large language model (LLM) that allows users to describe a cohort of patients and automatically generates GraphQL queries or custom queries based on the input for the PCDC. The goal is to simplify the process of building complex queries for patient data by allowing users to interact with the chatbot in natural language, rather than navigating through a UI or manually searching for filters.

## Appendix

1. The sample data is created in items.json 
2. For this implementation i have tried to use GEMINI AI api key for generating the GRAPHQL queries .

```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd DataForCommonGoodBot
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm run start
```


Make a .env file similar to .env-sample and place your LLM api key there (GEMINI) in my case .
